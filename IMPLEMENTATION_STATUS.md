**Last Updated:** 2025-12-25T16:30:00+01:00
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 Complete ✅
**Next Phase:** Phase 2 - Advanced Analytics

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETE ✅

### Implemented Features

#### API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/noaa/kp-index` - Real-time planetary Kp index
  - 1-hour caching
  - 24-hour history
  - Activity level classification
  - Trend calculation (rising/falling/stable)

- ✅ `/api/noaa/solar-wind` - Solar wind conditions
  - 5-minute caching (frequent updates)
  - Speed and Bz magnetic field
  - 24-hour history
  - Aurora condition status

- ✅ `/api/noaa/forecast-3day` - Geomagnetic forecast
  - 6-hour caching
  - Probability distribution across activity levels
  - 3-day outlook

#### UI Components
- ✅ `KpIndexChart.tsx` - Interactive Kp index visualization
  - Real-time current value
  - 24-hour line chart
  - Color-coded activity levels
  - Trend indicator
  - Responsive design with dark mode

- ✅ `SolarWindGauge.tsx` - Solar wind monitor
  - Speed gauge (0-1000 km/s)
  - Bz magnetic field indicator
  - Aurora condition status
  - Visual color coding

- ✅ `ThreeDayForecast.tsx` - 3-day forecast cards
  - Probability bars for each activity level
  - Daily breakdown
  - Alert notifications for high activity
  - Mobile-responsive grid

#### Demo Page
- ✅ `/noaa` - Full dashboard page
  - All components integrated
  - Educational information panel
  - NOAA attribution
  - Professional layout

### Technical Implementation

**Dependencies Added:**
```json
{
  "axios": "^1.7.9",
  "recharts": "^2.15.0"
}
```

**Caching Strategy:**
- Kp Index: 1 hour TTL
- Solar Wind: 5 minutes TTL
- 3-Day Forecast: 6 hours TTL
- Fallback to stale cache on API errors

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation
- Loading states
- Error messages with retry buttons
- Stale cache fallback

**Data Sources:**
